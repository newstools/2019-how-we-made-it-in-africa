Joseph Hundah Media is going through an inflection point at the moment and all media executives are trying to figure out the balance between new and traditional media. So, I would say how effective our digital strategy will be keeps me up at night. That my constant travelling is a pleasurable experience. Our chairman, Strive Masiyiwa. He has a clear vision and is relentless in its pursuit. Work harder than those around you. They may outsmart you, but they must never outwork you. Once my vision is clear, then quick and decisive decision making. A bad decision is better than no decision at all I am a Netflix addict. I spend a lot of time on my Kwesé Play set-top box. I also love cigars I am not an early riser; I am a late sleeper, so I would say 9am. But I am always the last one out of the office. “Tell us your weaknesses” is a fascinating question because almost everyone never actually answers it. Meeting industry and corporate titans and highly successful entrepreneurs. You learn so much about their approach to life and business I think there is an international gap in the health diagnosis industry. Imagine a machine that can take your blood or any type of body fluid and detect your potential health weaknesses and/or diagnose what is ailing you. I do think various entities are looking at this, but not 100% successfully. Whoever gets it right I believe will be highly successful. So frequently people are incorrectly treated purely through incorrect diagnosis. It’s absolutely tragic and something we should be able to solve in this generation.
