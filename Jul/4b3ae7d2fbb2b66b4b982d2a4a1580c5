 Profit-making idea is a series of short posts, each with a piece of information that we think you might find useful: for investment, for growing your company or to start a new business. Read our previous posts here. In a recent interview, we asked Samuel Amanor, CEO of BlueSPACE Africa – a Ghanaian business focused on financial technology integration – to name an untapped business opportunity in Africa. Here was his response: “Africa is, as they say, the new frontier. The biggest challenge for us as a continent, is talent. Africans are talented people but we lack knowledge and training. If we can localise training and knowledge, learn to share it within the walls of Africa, we can have a breakthrough. “In our sector, customers in banking have to travel to Dubai, London or the US for training on software. We don’t have access to those platforms in Africa. “The biggest opportunity I can see presently, is human capacity development or human capital development. That’s the big one.”
