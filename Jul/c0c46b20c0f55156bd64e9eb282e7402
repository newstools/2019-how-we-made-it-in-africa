 PRESS OFFICE: Africa CEO Forum The 8th edition of the Africa CEO Forum will be held on 9 and 10 March 2020 in Abidjan, Côte d’Ivoire, in partnership with the International Finance Corporation (IFC), a member of the World Bank Group. After a 2019 edition organised in Rwanda and marked by a record attendance of 1,800 participants from 70 countries, including 800 CEOs and four heads of state, the most influential business leaders from all over the continent will meet again in the Ivorian economic capital. For this new edition and more than ever before, our ambition is to give a greater voice to the private sector in the major debates that shape our African economies. The implementation of the Continental Free Trade Area (CFTA), improving the business environment, industrial development strategies, boosting competitiveness and many other challenges will also be at the heart of the 2020 agenda. We very much hope that you will join us on 9 and 10 March in Abidjan to take part in the discussions around Africa’s economic transformation.
