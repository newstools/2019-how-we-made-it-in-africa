Onyekachi Ekezie Onyekachi Ekezie is the CEO of Kaptain Foods, a Nigerian food processing company that produces and packages pre-cooked ready-to-eat stews using locally grown fresh produce and spices. The toughest challenge so far has been sourcing for financing to run operations. I was able to overcome that by bringing in equity and debt financing. We are in a market where banks are not keen on lending to SMEs, so overcoming this challenge was a huge confidence boost for me. I am most proud of taking an innovative idea and then creating a product that the market has accepted. Customers who give us positive feedback on the product also make me proud of the innovation. Most entrepreneurs like myself lack patience and worry too much because we want to succeed and succeed quickly. However, my board has kept me focused and also understanding that the journey is a marathon not a sprint. This has also allowed me to deal with challenges much better because I donâ€™t worry as much because I am more patient now. I hear people say just pray over it and it will work out. I believe you have to plan, put in the hard work along with prayer for you to be successful. I would have studied the market properly before launching the product so I could have made some adjustments to my strategy. Entrepreneurs need to really understand the problem they are trying to solve and identify the addressable market for your product or service at the right price point. About 87 million Nigerians live in extreme poverty, so I wish I had launched the sachet pack size, that would address the bottom segment of the economy, much earlier.
