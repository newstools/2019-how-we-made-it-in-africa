The day that we harvested and sold our first crop was most exciting for us because it represents the day that we took a farmer with no collateral from $0 all the way to harvest, meaning that YouFarm was no longer a theory. Our biggest mistake was not taking the dive and putting together a team quickly enough. As soon as we put the team together things went from zero to 100 very quickly. E-commerce for emerging markets.
